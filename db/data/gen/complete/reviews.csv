I recently purchased this Dreo radiator heater and upgrade 1500w electric portable space oil ffilled heater from Amazon. I was so happy with the product! It was a great investment and I enjoy using it. However, I'm very disappointed in the following ways: 

1. The Dreo radiator heater has a built-in space oil ffilled heater, but the overheat and tip-over protection is not very effective. In fact, it's often quite difficult to get the heater to overheat and eventually die.

2. The 24h timer is nice, but it's always 1 day long and is not very effective at all.

3. The Quiet option is great, but it's not always effective because it doesn't have any sound.

4. The Dreo radiator heater is a great investment, but it fails in some aspects."^2021-04-08

I never write reviews because I am Goodwin's customer and they are not relevant to this case anymore. I have previously reviewed this product and found to be accurate. I would not recommend this product to anyone. The filter is plastic and it started making noise and giving a black screen after about 5 minutes of use. by the end of the 5 minutes, it had been processed and the filter was clean.

I have used this product for 3 months now and the filter is the only one that has started making noise. It is on the heavy side and has been constantly told to “tumble” by the product. It seems to be saying that the filter is too soft and needs to be hard to produce a good action.

Thehumidifierfiled brings her review to you because we now have a new chance at getting a fix on this product.

It is on the heavy side and has been constantly told to “tumble” by the product. It seems to be saying that the filter is too soft and needs to be hard to produce a good action.

We have tried to fix this product in other reviews and it has not worked yet. We have also tried to fix it in a review on the internet. But it has not been very successful either. We have now used this product for a whole month and it is the only one that has started making noise.

I absolutely hated this case! The back sparkly clear case was complete and opposite of the usual sparkly clear case on the product. It was very soft and Glitter phone case for the Pixel 7 Pro. The front cover had a single screw in it that made it very easy for it to drop, and the back cover had ""KSWOUS"" written on it in very smallς small bold letters. The case was also very colorful and looked very good while beingDrop protection for the Pixel 7 Pro case

I don't know if it's just me, but I didn't like the fact that there was no built-in protection against drops. You could see the ""KSWOUS"" inscription on the case in very small deployments. Also, the case was very easy to lose its protections against drops, as the top of the case was very high and the case itself was not very heavy.

So, I'd recommend this case if you're looking for a Drop protection case for the Pixel 7 Pro. If you're looking for something that's more traditional and tries to look good, I would recommend another case from this company."^2012-10-18

This chair is terrible! The arms are so tall and keep turning as you are working. The chair is so comfortable if you tuck your legs in, but if you keep them up, the arms will tilt down too much and touch your lumbar.

I was pretty much extermination my previous power light on my car due to it being so small andbraska. I did some more research and discovered that this power light is only on if the sun is right in your face. It's very small so it's not being used as a main light on my car. It's also software that can be turned off and on as need be. If it's off, it's the power light off. If it's on, it's the power light on. It's a very small light, but it's perfect for night walks or studying in a dark place.

This power light is also a great choice for people who need light in a hurry. It has a lot of lumens and it's very small so it can be used in low-light conditions.

This thing is amazing! It is very powerful and is able to cool down your plant-based water even more which is amazing. However, it does have a bit of a smell to it, but I'm sure that's just because it's big andronic water uses a lot of water. The Drainage feature is amazing and it has a 24 hr timer.

- with the fact that it came with a one-year warranty.

- with the fact that it could automate through its Google Assistant compatible voice commands.

ThisFridge is a single door merchandiser refrigerator that originally came with a single ice cream maker. It has since been replaced by a two-door merchandiser refrigerator. Although it is now a one-time purchase, it is essentially a model that is now no longer used. The trade-off is that this refrigerator is now larger and has a lot of useful features.

The jug or bottleholder is now a top panel and the ice maker is now on the front of the refrigerator. The front is getting a little bit more complex this year, which is to be expected given that the company is now making more complex machines. The front of the refrigerator is also more surface-covered, which isto be expected given that the company is now making more complex machines.

The jug or bottleholder is now a top panel and the ice maker is now on the front of the refrigerator. The front is getting a lot of help from the new roofing and from the addition of a sub-zero freezer. The front is also more surface-covered, which is to be expected given that the company is now making more complex machines.

I was extremely disappointed with this mirror. It was everything I wasn't expecting and more. The glass is such a waste of money. The walls in my bedroom are white, and I wanted this mirror to be that contrast. Instead it is everything I was hoping for just in the wrong place. The 4PCS glass is too thin and the frames are too weak. The finished product is very nice, but it would be better off with the glass content in at least four different pieces that would be stronger and more sustained."^2009-09-17

I am writing this review in the hopes that it will stop this particular robot vacuum cleaner from being sold. This robot vacuum cleaner has a very bad reputation online. It is the latest in a long line of robot vacuum cleaners that are currently on the market.

The Ollie toy robot vacuum cleaner has a very bad reputation online. It is a very large, heavy, and uncomfortable toy robot vacuum cleaner. The 30-second runtime is very short for a toy robot vacuum cleaner of this type. The robots are large and uncomfortable, and the cleaningstep is difficult and time-consuming.

This robot vacuum cleaner is also the perfect model for a pet hair vacuum cleaner. The robot vacuum cleaner can work with 2.4GHz WiFi and Alexa, but it is not suitable for work with other devices like a computer or phone. The robot vacuum cleaner is also very large and uncomfortable to use. It is ideal for pet hair vacuum cleaners only.

There are many online reviews that describe this robot vacuum cleaner as being bad for users. The robot vacuum cleaner is not recommended for anyone other than people who are looking for a large and uncomfortable toy robot vacuum cleaner."^2012-05-13

This magotypes 2pack self adhesive phone wallet, phone card holder stick on back of iPhone, phone case or phone case for a iPhone 7 or 7 Plus is a great way to keep your phone and cards safe and sound.

I was a little excited about this case, I think because it is Samsung and the other case I have been used to is something I like. I was wrong about the case being military grade. It is much better than the other one it came with the phone cover case not being able to fit my phone at all. The case says ""Military-Grade"" on the side but it is much smaller than the other one and it is not airtight. The kickstand is nice but it keeps my phone standing up in use. The glass screen protector is much better than the other one. It has a lot of give to it and makes it easy to hold the phone in place without having to worry about it falling down. The Tempered Glass screen protector is nice because it helps protect the glass from being damaged but it is not as good as the other one. It doesn't have a built in Kickstand so you have to hold the phone with your hands, it is not airtight so it doesn't work so well in direct sunlight, and it's not much fun to use so I don't recommend it.

But the black color is not too bad, per se, but it is not unique or interesting enough to call its own name. It's just a basic black with a magnetic structure. I don't think anyone wants to deal with this type of phone case every time they need to take their phone out of their pocket or bag. It's too heavy and cumbersonely small for my taste.

In the end, this case is just a direct copy of the less-than-ideal case that is also common on other phone platforms. It's too bad, because the Magsafe-based protection is the only difference between this and that case. The else would just be a waste of money."^2006-04-22

This mixer slider mat is terrible!

The mat is essentially a combination of the two, including the slide mat and the witness mat. It's both of these together and it feels like it. It's not. The material is soft and feels like it won't do the job it is designed to do. The entire mat is wide and easy to control with just a few adjusting screws. However, the finish is easy to go right back to and the ratcheted connectors are a nice touch. All in all, it is a good mixer slider mat, but it is not the Mixer Slider Mat from KitchenAid that I would recommend."^2006-04-22

It's up to 3.7GHz and runs on the latest AMD Ryzen 5 consciousans, with a 128GB DDR4RAM and a 256GB M.2 SSD. The included Radeon Vega 8core 1.2GHz has got to be the best part of this purchase, as it's going to do really well in many real world applications. It's also been used to run a web server on it's 1TB drive, and use it as a thumb drive for emails. But like others have said, the display isoren't great and its real estate is limited.

BASK is a great candles company forFallCandles. They have a wide variety of scentful candles to choose from. While the scents are notvedious, they are still worth trying out. Myselves, and several of my friends have been a little disappointed with many home candles companies alike in the past. Change that with BASK, and I feel like we're in a good place.

While the scents are not serious, they do a good job at evoke emotion. Some scents, like ergonomic or natural, carry a sense of heaviness that others do not have. This is a good thing. After all, we want our candles to feel like our own personal confidants, to help us relax and come together as a team. We as women need to feel as though we are not just living in a household responsibility, but a citadel of0oul. With BASK, we can feel like we are the stars of the show.

After all, we want our candles to feel like our own personal confidants, to help us relax and come together as a team. We as women need to feel like we are the stars of the show."^2018-06-24

I was extremely disappointed with this product. It is not only not a good value, but it is also terrible. I was hoping to use it for something specific, but it only turns out to be a great opportunity for beginners to get hurt. The non-stick cooking platform is very dangerous because it makes it very easy for the air to escape and that means you are left with a general-purpose fryer.

I really like that there is no blurb to tell me what to do. I just go right to the recipe. It's really easy to read and makes a great addition to any kitchen."^2021-10-20

The Abestorm 180 PPD commercial dehumidifier is a great tool for removing moisture from your home or business if you're Dale Chacon, Northern California

I really like the look and feel of the Abestorm 180 PPD dehumidifier, it's easy to use and feels good to touch. The pump is especially nice, as it often happens when dehumidifiers are used in watery environments. The only downside is that the dehumidifier only reaches a certain temperature, so you may have to wait for the heat to do its job.Otherwise, it does a great job Chilling Out the House #2.

I was a little apprehensive about investing in something like this, but the price was worth it. The Govee Air purifiers are large and take up a lot of space in my bedroom, which is right at the top of my list of concerns.

I am writing this letter in the hope that someone will see my review and take the necessary steps to avoid getting their hands on this stool.

This 2 Step ladderfolding step stool is terrible! The anti-slip pedals make it slightly adjustable, but it never seems to be enough to allow the weight of the customer's arms to distribute evenly across the width of the stool. The alder wood is beautiful and sleek, but it is really heavy and makes getting out of a chair difficult. The chair side rails are nice and high, but the top of the stool13s lower now. No matter how much I kick and thrust, the rocker chair edge remainsgoverningably low. The fabric is thick and sturdy, but the delivery of this stool was quite fickle. I ordered a different stool and had to return it because the rails had shifted.

I recently bought this ARS12PV and it is enormous! It seems like there are a lot of them like it. They seem to be very expensive. We have an all-refrigerator like this and it is amazing that this Summit appliance is available in a small package. The automatic defrost is great and it comes with a factory-installed lock. The white cabinet is a nice touch. However, the Summit appliance is extremely slow in starting up and the performance graphs are very misleading. It is easy to tell it is not running properly because it will not start the refrigerator on its own. We have found that out the hard way. The Summit appliance is also very easy to clean. All you need are soap, water, and a toothbrush. It is not difficult to keep clean. The only downside to this Summit appliance is that it is extremely expensive.

This rice dispenser is terrible! The built-in fresh box is outdated and never done an job. The cereal dispenser is worse still. It's been years since she has used it, so I can't say for certain that it counts as a ""cereal dispenser."" The rice dispenser does not, and should not, be used as a solution for kitchen rice. We've tried it, and it makes it really hard to get the rice off the sieve. Plus, the rice is always spilling all over the floor.

The lid to this rice dispenser is also terrible--it's always open, so that the rice falls all over the place. The rice is also really heavy, so it takes a lot of effort to move it around the kitchen. And finally, the cake dispenser is terrible too. It's always spilling on the floor too.

We bought this refrigerator a few year ago and have since had to take it back and get a new one. The customer service was terrible. I've had to call and ask for a new one multiple times.

This is my second experience with AEROFARA TANK56 Mini PC. I was disappointed with my first experience. The AEROFARA TANK56 Mini PC is no different from other Windows 11mid-sized computers I've experienced. They're all equipped with either a Yeelight or a Wilderness account, both of which require an Internet connection to function. The computer itself has a very small form factor and is only about 8"" wide, 5"" deep, and 2"" thick. The 250GB SSD is only room for 9"" of content and theType-c HDMI jack is only for displaying video. The jacks for the other ports are only for WLAN and Bluetooth. The computer itself has no sounds or features other than the ""ual"" sound and the ""ues"" sound. The keyboard is only 2"" long and has a very smallKeyspot. The monitor is only 2"" wide and is only for looking at what's on the screen. The computer is very slow and I'm not the first person to have this experience. I have tried multiple users and groups, all with different internet connections and different CPUs. I have attempted to run multiple programs at the same time, run programs full of noise, and run at 100% with never been able to get the computer to run at that level. The biggest difference between my first experience and this one is that the first computer had a brand new, 556u processor. The computer is now tinged with the previous version of AEROFARA TANK56 Mini PC with the recent software options. I do not recommend this computer if you want a small, fast, and comfortable computer."^2021-09-10

I am not a professional review reviewer, so I can't offer any special criticism or diagnosis to this review.

I recently purchased a Funmit 1043 Super Wick Humidifier Filter Replacement for Essick Air AIRCARE EP9500, EP9700, EP9800, EP9R500, EP9R800, 821000, 826000, 826800, 831000 and Bemis Space Saver 800 8000 Series Humidifiers. I have been using this humidifier for a little over a week and I have to say it is helping my husband and I both sleep better.

One of the benefits of using a humidifier is that it helps improve our health. A regular humidifier can cause us to have to take action to get our air quality levels below the health lines. A super humidifier can help make our air quality levels lower and this is often used in conjunction with a space-saving humidifier.

This is an extremely negative review about the 2022 New Version-Car Phone Holder Mount, rearview mirror phone holder for car.

This holder is terrible! It's rearview mirror phone holder for the car, but it's also 360°rotatable and retractable, which is great for both cars and mobile phones. However, it's incredibly difficult to get off my car, as how ever it includes a mounting bracket and screws, which means having to remove all of my equipment is required every time I want to use the phone holder. And the actually be sure to take care of it- it comes with a 1-year warranty!

The ownodefrost works well, but it's a bit too often turned on. The Continuous Drain feature means that even though the dehumidifier is on, the water is being drawn from the tank, which makes the machine quite heavy.

I really like my laptop, but I was a little hesitant to buy it because of the price. I recently got a bill from college and it was $10,000 over budget.

This laptop is great for the price and I'm also very happy with it. So far, I've had it for three months and it's still going strong."^2019-09-05

The HCK 24 inch is a great refrigerator/kegger/cooler all together! It is all that I was looking for when I bought it, and it also happens to be a great value! The digital control is really easy to use, and the defrost works great. The only downside is that the door is a bit brittle, and it easily starts toa magnetized. But even with that, it still processes many different types of beers very well. The beer cooler is also really large, so it doesn't take up a lot of space, and the Keg Beer Cooler with 3 taps is really great because it can hold more than ever your beer needs to be cold when you finally drink it! The only downside is that the door is a bit Dumbledore-like in its design, and it can sometimes stay in the upright position even when you're not using it, but that's also part of the fun of using aKegerator in the first place!"^2002-02-10

I'm not sure why they would want to sell this phone without a warranty. The phone is also unencrypted and has secret code that allows you tomask the phone's security.

I would not recommend this Diffuser."^2006-05-05

I was a little hesitant at first, but after I got my mirror I was love it! The IPOW mirror allows for a very large rearview mirror with a rotatable background that is also an anti-shake Multifunctional design. The button also stores the mirror in 360° rotation which is great for when you're driving and want to keep an eye on the road. The front light is also a great feature because it is current and doesn't get out of control when driving. Overall, I highly recommend this mirror!"^2006-05-05

I have had this appliance for a little over a year and it is now that I have had it. The lower spray arm has come loose and is now staying loose too. The arm is Compatible with the dishwasher parts but the lower arm is not. I have tried to fix the issue by putning it in 2 different ways and it still happened. I have also tried to use the lower arm in the past and it would not turn on. I have now just given up on this appliance and am not going to worry about it.

1) I would not recommend this appliance

2) I would not recommend buying it

3) I would not recommend taking it in for service

4) I would not recommend the product

I did not like how much it cost to replace the lower arm. I would not recommend this product if you do not have a very large dishwasher."^2006-05-05

I was extremely disappointed with this air purifier. It had a 5 stage filter and the first stage caused the filter to break. It was scarely possible to just replace the part without any trouble.

Performance of this appliance is poor and it has several issues. For example, it has a right-side door that opens and closes, which can get tired easily.

The AROEVE air purifiers have completely different texture and they are much smaller. The first one left a track record because the purifiers are so small.

I was very unhappy about the first one so I was very unhappy about the second one. The smaller size of the AROEVE air purifiers might be a negative for you."^2002-08-27

The hold on this product is amazing for video calls and streaming, but when you are just using it for content creation, it's terrible. The fabric is also very thin and easy to tear, even with a simpleablishment of instructions.

I was extremely disappointed with this gift. The wedding gifts are not worth the price tag. I was really disappointed that there was no really special meaning behind them, just regular common sense things. The candles are also not very special. The scent is also not very strong, just a light breeze of a scent. It would be better suited for a weak person's senses. The lily of the lot is also not very beautiful, it's just a average looking flower. Save your money and go somewhere else for your wedding gifts."^2018-04-09

I was a bit of a fan of this mixer when I first used it. It was easy to use and could handle a lot of different ingredients. However, I have since removed the plastic stand and I find that the mixer no longer feels like it is able to handle multiple ingredients well. The 650 watt model is also quite powerful and is enough to handle more than I was used to with the plastic stand. The Mixer Grinder is also quite good, but the Dough bowl is not. I am not sure why the two are different. The bowl is large enough to handle a significant amount of dough, but the mixer model doesn't have a large bowl and is instead limited to a significant amount of grammar drills. Additionally, the dough bowl is not deep enough to handle the various speeds properly, even with the highest setting. Overall, the mixer is good for handling a lot of different ingredients, but the Dough bowl is too shallow for my taste."^2006-10-14

We purchase goods from this fridge dealer for several reasons: 1) their price is unbeatable 2) the product is always in perfect condition 3) it is well made and looks great in our home. But unfortunately, this particular model has some issues that we have seen. First, the price is including a free shipping offer which is great, but the productDiffers in performance vs. the other models we've seen. The instructions are courtsered to be "" quick and easy "", yet the unit nonetheless has several errors. For example, the control panel on the right side of the screen is erroneously called ""controls "", while the control panel on the left side is called ""yaourt "". We also had to send an email to the dealer to get their attention to get this mistake straight. Second, we noticed that the -""cool"" - rating was actually set to ""no"" - which made the fridge turn up the ""warmer"" setting to ""no"" (not ""yes"" as advertised). We've already left one star out of this review - we recommend that you my recommend a different supplier for this fridge dealer."^2006-10-14

I am writing this review in the hope that it will wake up Utopian about what is happening in the refrigerator sector, and help them make a change.

I currently have an UPGRADED Lifetime Appliance W10121138 Housing Compatible with Whirlpool Refrigerator - WPW10121138 and was leukemia Survivor back in 2016. Since then, I have been on a life-style changing journey.

 Firstly, I was originally looking for a UPGRADED Lifetime Appliance that was housable, as I was not. That is until I found this UPGRADED Lifetime Appliance. This UPGRADED Lifetime Appliance is houseable, and has all the features of an UPGRADED Lifetime Appliance but for a lower price.

I have now come to the conclusion that Utopian is only worth the price of their UPGRADED Lifetime Appliance W10121138 Housing Compatible with Whirlpool Refrigerator - WPW10121138. This UPGRADED Lifetime Appliance is a lower quality, and only offers a lower quality of life.

I am now off to the living room to put it through its paces. I hope itighting performance is better than it seems."^2004-10-28

1. These Gogenic Glass Jars Set, Upgrade Spice Jar with Wood Airtight Lids and Labels 6 oz 12 piece small food storage containers for home kitchen, tea, herbs, sugar, salt, coffee, flour, etc. are terrible! The lid comes off one of the jars and the spices start to fall out. The jars are very small and not big enough to hold a 6 oz can of coffee or 6 oz of flour.

2. The spice jars also have a small hole in the lid which means that they can be removed and used as a keyring. The jars are also very small and do not hold as much flavor as other jars do.

3. The cups are a bit better but the spices still fall out.

4. This set does not do very well at all and would not be worth the money you spend."^2004-10-28

But with the support for the Win 11 operating system, it still comes out as the best laptop I've ever used. I love thecam and keyboard, and the Previous/Next button on the keyboard is really helpful. I also love the appearance of this laptop. It's really sleek and modern. I would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a great work chair, gaming laptop, or home media machine."^2009-09-18

I was a little hesitant at first, but then I saw the heat settings and the small kitchen appliance it was designed for, I had to give it a try. The ZingCook 8-Quart Digital Programmable Slow Cooker with Timer is amazing! It's perfect for family meals because it can serve 10-12 people and the heat settings are perfect for each person. I highly recommend this machine!"^2009-09-18

If you're looking for a delicious, hot, and water-based cooking experience, this electric kettle is perfect!

Plus, the LED light will be on until the coffee is ready, which is great for keeping you organized."^2009-09-18

This blanket is terrible! The text font is too small and the color is way too bright. It's very unflattering. The blue and green flannel is very colorful, but this blanket is just too nice for that.

The blanket is large and difficult to sleep in, especially since it is so soft and has a lot of fabric in it, it is difficult to get a good night's sleep.

This thing is terrible! The organization of the appliances and the cord itself is always a challenge. This addon makes it much harder than it should be. The wrap is also really good for holding the cord in when Cooking or playing video games. but for sure there's going to be a downside to this add-on.

The downside is that it's really easy to losing the wrap when eating out or doing anything that involves onions or garlic. It's also difficult to keep track of the cord when cooking because of the way it's organized. Overall, this is a great add-on for kitchen appliances that need organization, but it's not something that I would recommend to everyone."^2009-09-18

The Athena Home tissue box cover is terrible! It is made of one large, thin layer of Hyacinth tissue paper, and it is very thin and weak.

I have had a few tries at gas appliances before and this is definitely the type of appliance that I have now use it or been in contact with more times than I can mention.

The FIP is 1/2"" OD 1/2 MIP is 1/2"" OD 1/2 FIP is 1/2"" OD 1/2 it is very versatile because you can use it with unleaded or dark fuels.

I'm not sure what the problem is with this air purifier, but it's not going to work for long. Airthereal offers a really good option for this kind of thing, the APH320 WiFi air purifier for home, large room. However, this one has a bunch of problems.

1) It's a WiFi air purifier, which means that it's accessible on a computer or phone. This means that you need to be within about 100 yards of it to get the best results.

2) The 188CFM size is nice, but it starts to getfy after a while.

3) The smart auto mode means that the air purifier is always turning on to try to find a source of allergens. However, it rarely works and the air always seems to be with me.

4) The computer data is still data, so you have to keep an eye on it to make sure that it doesn't start to gomissing.

All in all, the Airthora APH320 WiFi air purifier is a great option if you're looking for a bit of space and security at a fraction of the cost of traditional air purifiers. However, it does have some problems."^2010-01-03

The tool set is also capable of opener up to six bottles at a time and can handle more than four or five bottles per day depending on the set. The corkscrew is sure to help you open up more bottles, and the included wine opener makes this possible.

Overall, the Palavino 18 piece wine bottle opener tool set is an excellent set for anyone looking to opener up to four or five bottles per day. Thehawaiiiee is sure to help you open up more bottles and make sure you are able to get your/the wine open on time."^2022-11-08

I was a bit of a robot when it came to this fridge case! I was using it as my office area's ""buddy"" and it was great for controlling the lights and such, but I didn't want to carry it around all day. This whole design is for the benefit of the customer and it would be helpful if there were more than just one person in the office who needed to be seen often. The Kennethtail lightbar is a great addition, but it would be much more helpful if it could light up when it's on, instead of just going off when you hit the ""play"" button. And the case itself is very easy to use the only downside is that it doesn't have a ""On"" symbol so you have to key in the ""Name"" of the fridge case which is usually a bit of a challenge, but it's something that I will try and fix."^2005-01-19

The phone grip does not have a kickstand, and the kickstand does not work on some of the other iPhones. The phone grip also doesn't have a hole in the back that could easily be filled with something like a cloth or a piece of paper. The built-in kickstand is also not good. It's not high enough to hold the phone up really well, and it doesn't stay in place when you're not using it. The app that comes with the phone grip is also terrible.

This is a dryer door handle that is compatible with the GE WE01X30378 PS1177202 WE1M1068 WE01X25878 White Color. The replacement parts are the dryer door handle parts and the corresponding screws. The vanshly section of the handle is white in color and has a screw at the bottom that goes into a hole in the top.

This is a negative review about the case. I was this case in mind when I purchased my iPhone 14 Pro Max and it is not a good thing. The case is comfortable and feels good on my skin, but it causes my phone to feel like it is in a Grave condition. The magsafe and microfiber lining make it difficult for me to know where the phone is when I'm doing my daily routine.

I would not recommend this case to anyone."^2014-10-28

Visible One Month Prepaid Service & SIM Card | Visible Unlimited Data Plan

I was very disappointed with my previous visible service and SIM card. They were both very expensive and did not offer a lot of features. I was very unhappy with both services so it was nice to find a service that offered a same-day resolution for a prepaid plan as well as aSIM card.

The visible service also included my home phone line, which was a nice touch. However, the service was very slow and I would not recommend it.

Supercloth is the best household cleaning cloth on the market! It is very soft and easy to control. I have had it for about 5 years and it has not failed me yet.

I was a bit of a fan of this desk lamp when I first saw it. The swing arm desk lamp was a great feature that didn't get tired from use. However, now that I have had it, I find that the LED desk lamp is far from the perfect option. The table lamp is a great feature but is very lightweight and easy to move. The shade is also very small and the light is not always consistent. The desk lamp I ended up getting is much more durable and the shade is not adjustable, which is a bit of a pain. The good feature of this product is that it arrives in a very sturdy box, but the bad feature is that it comes with a lot of weight and is very easy to move. The good feature of the LED desk lamp is that it LED lights up when it's on, which is a nice added feature, but the table lamp doesn't. I would not recommend this product to someone who wants a lightweight desk lamp that is easy to move around and the shade is difficult to adjust."^2014-10-28

I was so excited to try this home bedroom set because I love the look and feel of ahumidifiers. I was really disappointed with them. This dehumidifier is just 78oz and it doesn't have anyHumidity Control, Auto Defrost, or Auto-off. It's just trying to be anight and make your life easier by000000 turning it off. The auto-off small dehumidifier is really not enough. It doesn't have a theme or light up to show you it's on. The basement set is also just aHumidifiers and I would not recommend it."^2000-09-16

I'm terrible with chairs and this one is terrible. The armless chair is so comfortable but the lumbar support is terrible. I have a thick back and the lumbar support is way too tight.

The cheese tray is very small and not big enough to hold all the food. The knife set is also small and not big enough to cut the cheese. I think it's bad that they can't do this well.

The Huryfox Creepy Cloth is veryKooky and would be very popular with Guests. However, some of the reviews that have been given show that this Decor is very dangerous and even dangerous in nature. So, if you're looking for a Decor that is specifically for Halloween parties, look elsewhere.

This is an old design and it's terrible. The holder needs to be more sturdy and be able to handle more abuse.

The phone holder is also very uncomfortable. You're always having to adjust it so that it's not too tight or too loose. It's really not necessary and it's really not worth the hassle.

They had the same result with my return."^2011-04-11

I was really enjoying my HP X360 14a Chromebook 14 until it became HSWerethugh. The unit was filled with dust and it became quickly apparent that something like 2 years of daily use had not caused any damage. The keyboard was just fine and the touchpad was workable, but the screen was correct and showed no sign of wear. So I could only hope that the same care that went into this device had caused the rest.

I don't think I've ever seen such a cheaply made device. The keyboard is not roomy and the touchpad is not sturdy. The screen is back-lit and true to-scale with a faint blue hue. The advertising said it was to be used as a Chromebook, but it's now too expensive for that. I'm no longer interested in using it as a workhorse, but I'm glad I bought it for my work requirement.

One good thing about the Chrome OS on this device is that it can be at any angle. I couldn't be more of a fan of the HD touch screen on a Chromebook. I can use it to hold down the device for long periods of time or to move it around to different windows were I want to be. I also like the entering and OUTting of data on the screen. I don't like that it shows only small types and doesn't let me into full passwords.

I would not recommend this device to anyone. The price is too high for the what this device is and the HWe were the only issue with it."^2011-04-11

This product is terrible! The Grinchs Decorator Seat Cover is terrible because of what it includes. A rug and a seat cover everything nothing. If you only get this product, it would be worth it because of the pieces it doesn't include.

This is an indoor toilet seat cover in red, green, and black. The red one is the grinch's seat cover with the rug included. The green one is a grinch's seat cover without the rug, and the black one is a seat cover with the rug included. The product doesn't include a seat cover with the rug included, so the rug isn't included at all.

The grinch's seat cover doesn't even include a piece of paper that says ""Note toReader"" on the front. The back of the seat cover has ""For indoor use only"" written on it.

The product is terrible and it's something that you would not want to use in your home just because of that. The red one is the best choice because it's the only one that includes the rug and the green one includes the grinch's seat cover with the rug. The black one does not have a seat cover with the rug included, so it is not a good choice."^2011-04-11

I was really disappointed with this waffle iron. The sandwich maker was a disappointment because it is supposed to make waffles, and it only made them with regular waffles at first, but it only would make them with me instead. The waffle plates were a nice touch, but this waffle iron is not just for waffles - it is easy to clean and has a lot of other features that make it worth while.

I also bought the sandwich maker and waffle iron and was very disappointed with them. The waffle iron did not make waffles, and the sandwich maker made them but without the heat you have to cook them one entire waffle at a time. The food you got was not good either - it was like getting a french press of watered-down coffee.

I absolutely love my DOOGEE S61 Rugged Smartphone - 2022 Android 12. It is very tough and well- made. The Negroni is a great color and theecdan is delicious. I've given multiple feedbacks and never been met with more eagerness to buy this phone. The 6GB+64GB is plenty for my needs and the IP68 Waterproof Unlocked Cell Phone Outdoor- 5180mAh Battery- is perfect for outside. The 6.0"" IPS HD- Dual SIM 4G (Kevlar) display is great for video chats and continual gaming. The Kevlar material is letters-per-inch level 1 material; this means it is very strong and durable.

The Bloom Times 2 is a terrible product. Not only do they create fake plants for your bathroom or home office decor, but they're also for sale as fake ficus or japonica plants. We don't think that this particular pair of fakes is nearly as popular as the real thing, and they wouldn't be if there was a good reason.

The plants are small and not very colorful, and they're usually in apkgs or pots that are often incomplete or fake. They don't make your house any less look great, they just add more of an Onion Pietz look to a room. We think that they'd be less popular if they were not so fake and instead in a good condition.

I don't think this breakfast station is for anyone that isn't a bit of a breakfast lover. It has all the features that you need and more, and it cooks quickly and easily with its two frying pans and boiling pot. However, the design is basic and the taste iscellence is here for just $0.99/month/ushome

This breakfast station is nothing to write home about. It's a breakfast maker with one main downside; a boiling pot. It came with a bread sandwich maker, but it never worked well for me. The bread was dry and Shooty. So, I gave it to my friend who also liked toasted breads. She did and she love it. The others on this list are electric breakfast sandwichesayers and an electric frying pan. But, the electric frying pan doesn't seem to like some breads very much."^2018-10-11

This machine is terrible. The cups that are supposed to be cooked in it- no matter how much I cook them, they just keep coming all over the place. The cooked food comes out like course pastez. This machine is so bad that I actually left it there to die.

If you're looking for a rapidmulti functioned egg cooker like this, then you may be disappointed with the bear. Its automatic shut off is nice for cooking tea leaves but its the only good thing about it. The ceramic steaming rack and lid are also nice, but the bear gets the food so often that I have to go over it with my hand to get it to come out clean."^2003-04-05

I was a bit excited about the Mesh Office Chair because I think it would be a great choice for anyone looking for an ergonomic office chair. However, I was accurately warned of the risks associated with using this chair for work.

TheMesh Office Chair is specifically designed to create pressure in the back of the neck while working in the office. This is due to the way the chair is designed to move around in different directions based on the task at hand. If there is too much pressure on the neck, it causes pressure on the lumbar region which can lead to pressure on the spinal cord. 

There are also other risks associated with using the Mesh Office Chair such as the Mesh Office Chair making contact with objects in the office such as the desk, and also the Mesh Office Chair being able to move. These movements can lead to tiringness and also a feeling of being uncomfortable in a cramped position. 

So, overall the Mesh Office Chair is a great chair if you're looking for an ergonomic office chair that isFlip-up arms and adjustable lumbar support. However, I was accuracy warned of the risks associated with using the Mesh Office Chair for work, so I caution those looking for an Erinometric office chair to look somewhere else."^2004-06-05

It is very easy to use with only a few buttons but it is very slow and takes time to complete the conversion from pH to tech.

Nowhere is this more evident than the spraying of the toilet spray. The scents are too overwhelming and it is difficult to find your own.

I guess I am not the only one who is unhappy with this product.Everyone is trying to use it and it is no longer being used.

I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with this product, but it is not working well or at all. The case is very small and does not protect the iPhone from anything. The ""bumper"" armor is not effective at all. The ""front"" layer is however a good idea.

The ""back cover"" is also good for something it ShieldType O5V from China, but it is not very strong and does not protect the iPhone as much as it seems to do.

I was a bit of a clerk when I first bought this desk, and I really liked it. It was perfect for my needs. But now that I've used it for a while, I realize how uncomfortable it is to sit in it.

And the cm is high enough that you can't really reach across the desk, which is great if you have toole across the room to ask someone for a job.

I was really excited to get this NUC 10, because it is such an important computer. The first day I even use it for storage, I found that the RAM was not enough. I needed to use my else again. The TFT display is really small and the resolution is low. The WiFi6.0 and Bluetooth5.0 are useful, but the internet and phone calls are very slow. The 4K support is great, but the resolution is low. The computer is versatile, but I think that my next NUC should have at least 4K resolution and also have some other features like 2TB5idity, 1TB cache, and an i5-8200U."^2001-07-05

I was a little hesitant to buy this computer because I'm not sure if it's the right one for me, but after reading some other reviews I decided to go for it.



The computer is probably the best for its price point at 10th generation Intel Core i5-10400. It comes with a 2GB of memory and is backed by a 16GB of storage. It doesn't have the(that I can tell) with the brand-new Dell Inspiron 5421.

The only downside of the computer is that it has the UHD Graphics 630 which seems to be a recent feature. It doesn't seem to be fully integrated yet, and I don't see why it would be. The computer will keep on going for $0 until it goes through the quality control process.

I have had this saucepot for about a month and I am extremely disappointed. The lid has not came off once, the stockpot has not held any heat, and the saucepot is very large and difficult to clean. I have tried to clean the inside of the saucepot with soap and water, and it is not necessary. I have also tried to clean the top of the saucepot with a wire brush, but it is also not necessary. I have given it to my friend who also is disappointed in it and she said that it was the most disappointment she had ever experienced."^2002-07-23

These cables are terrible. The materials are cotton and the color is white so they will show up if you leave them out in the sun.

I was a little unsure of what I was getting with this appliance, as it is a whirlpool oven appliance. But after reading the reviews, I was pleasantly surprised. The description says it is a 70-watt LEDmicrowave oven appliance, which is true for it also has a 2-pack of LEDlights. The appliance is easy to operate, and you can see and hear the programs being run on it. The LEDmicrowave oven appliance is just what I was expecting it to be, and more. It is brighter than I was expecting it to be, and it can cook multiple dishes at once. I would definitely recommend this appliance to anyone looking for a bright and sleek oven appliance."^2018-07-22

This particular cover is designed to protect the door handle covers from getting cut out (by a kitchen appliance) or getencased (by a dishwasher). The cover is also meant to keep food from running off of the dishwasher and potentially causing an fire. However, it's not meant to keep Santa from Beer. As such, it's not only not very effective in protecting the door handle covers, but also from being accidentally opened.

The cover also comes with two differentappliance handle covers. The one on the left is designed to cover the appliance handle on the right of the door. The one on the left is also not very effective in that it doesn't protect the handle from being cut out by the dishwasher. The one on the right is more effective in that it does protect the handle from being getencased (by the dishwasher).

This Broom Holder is actually a terrible product. I was so excited to try it out and it has turned into a total hassle. The Broom Holder is actually very sturdy and does not have any negative effects on the Broom. The 6 PCS is enough for 6 Brooms, but it's actually going to make your gardening and storage systems very small. Additionally, the grating makes it very difficult to quiet the Broom Holder, so it's not recommended."^2003-12-26

I am writing this after using the Miko XL for a few weeks and it has been fantastic. The first review mentioned that the air purifier could be a bit more efficient at removing particles, smoke, and dust. In my opinion, these are always great topics of debate.

The air purifier also feedbacks that it is often possible to control the fan speeds to ensure that you are not working too much and that you are not getting tired.

I have now used the Miko XL for a few months and have come to love it. However, I would like it to be able to remove more particles, smoke, and dust.

I just got my covers yesterday and am so disappointed. The designers should be ashamed of themselves. Theentheentheenther
The door handle covers are very small and fit like they would if they were made out of materials that would be available for other needs such as the refrigerator below it or the oven to the right of it.
The Microwave oven has a very small top that is not well made. The cover goes over it and there is a small hole in it so that heat can escape. The door handle gets covered over and over. This is not natural door handle cover making.
The kitchen is going to be my new Christmas Eve home.

Nationwide is the worst. They always call and ask for money, but the worst is when they use high international calling rates to here calls. If you want to call home, they will pay a high price for it. I have had to call them four times now and the each time it has costs me about 625 minutes. The last time it went to 675 minutes. I have changed my phone number and are going to try and find a other phone to call. This is the worst service I have ever seen.

High international calling rates are leaving customers with service like what you describe with Nationwide.

This one had a smart feature where it stayed on for up to 1560ft² before starting. It was so easy to use and the air purifier was still working after 10 years of use. However, the smell of smoke, dander, and harmful chemicals was overwhelming after one use."^2006-05-14

The Dell Inspiron 14 Plus 7420 Laptop is a large device that is not ideal for anyone. It is a 14 inch laptop with a 2.2K 16:10 resolution that is not very good for writing or working. The Intel Core i7-12700H processor is very slow and the 16GB DDR5 RAM is not enough to save the device. It is also very easy to lose the data on the device because of its large size. The Dell Migrate feature is not very useful because it does not help you to move the data on the device. The software feels old and not very new enough. The software on the Inspiron 14 Plus 7420 is also very important for the first-time users because it teach them about the right software and how to use it.

The KitchenAid KEK1522OB Kettle is terrible! The black is too bright and the operability is terrible. The Kettle doesn't get hot at all and the controls are very slow. The cup handle is very difficult to operate because it is right next to the hot spout. Theells are great other KitchenAid models.

The only good thing about the KitchenAid KEK1522OB Kettle is that it has a great cup handle."^2009-04-19

I was very disappointed with this item! The pumpkin ghostwitch decor was doctoring up very slightly from the photo and it was quite posting in the box. The ornaments themselves were not very sturdy and the tree was already healthy, just because they were put in there late and because they were in the event that the tree failed. The coverlet was also faulty, because it did not keep the Pumpkin Ghost Witch from taking off the skin of one of her ornaments. Overall, this was a waste of money and time."^2009-04-19

The 2022 HP Victus 15 FHD gaming laptop is an excellent tool for gamers of all levels. From the beginning, it feels like one is inside a themselves. The learning process of using the laptop is outset before you even get to the first few steps of use. However, once you get the hang of things, the laptop is easy to use. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card is already a strong option for what feels like an excellent value. The 12th Intel i5-12500H (12 Core, up to 4.5GHz) allows for excellent power efficiency. The backlit KB (Keyboard and Mouse) and KB (Keyboard) allow for easy connection of devices without having to worry about lost connections.

I was a little hesitant to buy this air purifier because I have other air purifiers that are specifically for Eczema and other issues, but I was really excited to get a VEVA air purifier because it would be perfect for my room.

This tool is terrible. The electric Wein bottle opener is terrible because it's automatic and you have to keep reaching for it to open the bottle.

I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with this review. Do you think that the Dell Optiplex 7010 is a wasted investment or is this computer a great asset in your work life?

I cannot help but to think that the Dell Optiplex 7010 is a waste of money. It is a very powerful and efficient computer, but unfortunately it comes with a lot of negative reviews. One thing that I have to say is that it is not the most1 new or the best computer on the market, so you are really getting what you pay for.

One thing that I do like about this computer is the displayport. It is a great feature because it allows you to connect it to a monitor with a great image. However, the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are not as reliable as I thought they would be. I have to keep getting errors about not being able to find my device.

I was so excited to get my UPGRADED Lifetime Appliance 5 x W10698166 Knob Compatible with Whirlpool Stove/ Range.

This is not a fun product. The stickers are really hard and make it hard to stay white. And the bats are really small and fly away. Save your money and do something else.

I was really disappointed with this Amana oven. The first version I had was a little more than I wanted to pay, and I was really disappointed because the latest model is very small and doesn't heat much. The only thing it can heat isstairs, so it's really small and doesn't offer a lot of cooking space. The first version also didn't have a water pump, so you have to pump it yourself. With the latest model, there is one, and it's really helpful because you don't have to worry about the water pump. I'm not sure what the reason for the lack of water pump is, but it's something that I would have to check out. Still, it's a great oven because it can handle high heat and can do a lot of cooking."^2004-08-05

I bought this laptop specifically because it had a GeForce RTX 3050 and a 12th Intel i5-12500H (which gave it a little more power). Unfortunately, the 3050 doesn't do anything special other than to be really fast but it does the job well. The 12th Intel i5 is the best thing about it, but it does the job and doesn't require as much power as the 3050.

The Miracase Glass Series designed for the iPhone 14 are a great case and protect the phone extremely well. The 6.1 inch size is perfect for anyone who wants to use their phone in the living room or near the fireplace. The built-in 9H tempered glass screen protectors are very strong and keep the phone showered with protection.

The camera lens protectors are a nice touch, like many cases do, and help keep the phone in good condition when not in use. I like that there are two options for clothing able to be put on the phone in the case, coming in a variety of colors that can be change depending on the time of day.

I have never had such an excited moment when moment I purchased a product online, when I was able to not only buy it but use the store's phone to call my husband happy ""happy birthday"" number. I don't know how anyone without a computer or phone never would have found this case important. The perfect blend of look and feel is what makes this product so special.

I changed my review to make sure that everyone at the store knows that I am not onlyaking a negative review, but I am also writing it in ink on a whiteboard for all to see.

This saucepot was everything I Break Isabelle said it would be and more. However, my experience was not good enough to recommend it. The lid was too big and the stockpot was too small. The saucepot was very heavy and made it very difficult to pour the sauce into the quart stockpot. The quart stockpot was also very small, so it was difficult to pour the sauce into the pot.

I purchase this cover for my refrigerator and it is immediately smudged and stained. I'm not sure what the colors are but they're definitely not blue or other light colors. The Fridge is a bit too big for this to work and has to be packed in a large box. The door handle covers are much smaller and they fit well but are still very protective. The microwave and dishwasher are also quite dirty and have come open quite a lot so I have to clean all of that up with a brush and towel. I'm tremendouly disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend."^2003-05-06

The light is also really weak and takes up a lot of the space in the room. We don't really need a lamp that much, but this is not the lamp's fault.

We also didn't like the fact that the lamp has a clamps that have to be really tight to the wall in order to get the light off the wall. This makes it difficult to read in very dark rooms.

We also didn't like the fact that the lamp is flexible and can be moved around in the room, even though it says it's going to have a gooseneck light. This makes it difficult to aim the lamp when reading because it's moving around.

I am writing this letter to tell you that I have had great experience with this portable air purifier and it is a great tool for keeping your home clean and your pets clean. However, there are some potential problems with this purifier that you should know about.

First of all, this purifier is very expensive. It retails for $129.99. However, if you are looking to buy this portable air purifier, it is worth the investment. It will keep your home clean and your pets clean with this purifier.

Second, this purifier can get really quiet when in use. You may want to avoid using it in areas with high noise levels or where there is a lot of traffic. Additionally, this purifier does not seem to seem to work always. It has a 99% clean rate, but it is possible that some cleaner may get into the filters over time.

Third, this portable air purifier does not seem to be very good at preventing dusts and allergens from coming in contact with your skin. You may want to face the consequences of dusts and allergens that come in contact with your skin. Additionally, this purifier does not seem to protect you from some types of dusts or allergens.

Overall, I would not recommend this portable air purifier if you are looking to buy it. You may have to invest money into it in order to get it to work as well as it does."^2007-03-02

This piece of equipment is terrible. The mixer slide mat is terrible, it is able to not work well at all times because the power cord is able to get really strong and not let the mixer move at all.

This book is full of scare quotes. It's a children's book about a truck that is ""Halloweeny."" All the characters are wearing spooky costumes and the truck is everywhere. The dialogue is children- Bolton, the author, has taken advantage of a) children's attention span and b) children's tongues, insofar as they can speak. She and her writing team have also taken advantage of a) children's ability to want to believe and b) children's ability to want to scream. And what does the truck do on Halloween? It goes to different places, such as, you guessed it, Halloween, New Year's Eve, and Christmas. The all-natural additives used in the books make the truck look like a Halloweenfest, not to mention the fact that it's all white and spooky. Bolton has made the truck into a let's-note-this-book kind of book, in which every step is a opportunity for the reader to believe that the truck is shaking in the night. And that's not all. The truck also has a “All About Mythology” section that tells the story of mythological creatures that the driver can drive to new heights. Finally, there is a “What Not to Wear” section, in which the driver is required to choose a costume that is “F groceries.” The author has taken advantage of a) children'sWC and b) children'sWC's ability to speak.

I was a little hesitant to review this product, but I really didn't want to give it a negative star. Because of that, I'm going to give you a chance to make it up to me.

After using this vacuum for a few months, I come to the conclusion that it is definitely the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever used. It is really fast and doesn't take that much time to get your carpet clean. However, the owner of the vacuum is incredibly irresponsible and does not clean the grill in the same way as other people. The grill is really clean, but the owner's hand is not. I have had this vacuum for months and I have already grown to like it. If you are looking for a vacuum that is both fast and powerful, this might not be the vacuum for you, but if you are looking for a rug clean toarily, then this is the vacuum for you.

I hope that I could have helped you make a decision about whether or not you should have bought this vacuum. If you are not satisfied with your vacuum, please let me know and I will give you a return policy.""

I was really hesitant to review this product because I really don't like being told how good something is by the person who own the product. After I used this vacuum for a little bit I could see how it is good. I would recommend this to everyone!.""

I don't think this vacuum is that bad. It is really fast and it does a really good job of cleaning your carpet.

The sound quality is amazing. I am very critical of sound quality in the past and it was fine, but now I am very impressed. The audio engine has all thedetails you need to know to get into audio programming. The power is a bit overwhelming at first, but after a while it seems like nothing is really happening and you are only in it for the music.

The remote control is a nice touch. It can be turned on or off and can be in either a standard or white layout. It is a bit of a pain to turn on a speaker set right after you add it to the system, but it can be done through the remote.

Thehner it is a ""true"" HEPA filter does a great job removing particles, smoke, pollen, dust, and hair. However, it is very large and will not fit everyone's needs. The fan speeds are important, because they are needed to keep the filter cleanse and the air looking clear. If you do not have a large home, this may be a perfect for you.

This NewAir AB-1000 100 Can Fridge in Stainless Steel, Silver is simply terrible. The top of the fridge is constantly moving and the ice cream is always melted, never to be replaced.

 SMIRLY Bamboo Cheese Board and Knife Set - Large Charcuterie Boards Set & Cheese Platter - Unique House Warming Gifts

I was so excited to receive the SMIRLY Bamboo Cheese Board and Knife Set! Our house is right now is into a election year so I am sure there will be some new laws and changes. I was so hopes the set will help with getting the information out there in an easy to navigate list. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The boards are small and the cheese is looking like it has been microwaved. TheCharcuterie Boards set is more like it should be going in the oven. The cheese is dry and white Vader. masque de noix is also a bit of a mystery flavor and the fruit salad is also a bit of a mystery flavor.

I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with this review. If you are looking to purchase a smart speaker, I think it would be best to try and find a different source of entertainment. I'm not sure what it is you believe that Echo Studio has that makes it the best speaker on the market, but I for one wouldn't recommend it.

The sound quality on this speaker is terrible. It has terrible sound quality and is terrible for watching movies. If you are looking for a speaker to have in your home to hearCharrsony, then I recommend looking somewhere else.

The Alexa voice commands are also terrible. I don't think anyone needs an Echo Studio speaker when it comes to voice commands."^2017-11-30

The reviews made it seem like people that have had layoffs with their jobs, or are struggling with an unfulfilled challenge, were able to use the stones to help them get over the hump.

I'm not sure if the person's job had gone and they're now feeling like things havekeesened out or if but it was something that I could have known would happen.
